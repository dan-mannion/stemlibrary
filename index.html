				<p>	This library contains a number of educational workshops and demonstrations which span a wide range of topics and are flexible in terms of ability. Ultimately this library is here to encourage staff and students to get out and teach. 
				</p>
			
				<p>Each project box is packed with the required materials, a materials list, teaching resources and a fully working demonstration. Be aware, if you are engaging with a larger audience you may need to order extra parts. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Information on each of the projects are found by following the adjacent links. If you have any demonstrations or ideas you would like to contribute to the library please contact Dan Mannion at zceedjm@ucl.ac.uk. Equally any issues or suggestions should be forwarded there as well.
